# Learning Base Web

We understand that learning new libraries have their own set of challenges. To help you get started, we are here to help!

## Your first Base Web example

You can find the simple Base Web application example in the [Usage](/getting-started/usage) section. It only contains a button.

## Your next Base Web example

A more complex application using Base Web can be found [here](https://github.com/tajo/fusion-baseui). It helps you build an application
on top of Base Web, step by step.

## Next steps

It's time for you to build something on your own! If you got stuck, or if you've built something using Base Web,
please let us know. We're happy to help or feature your application on this website!

You can reach us in our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/baseui/shared_invite/enQtNDI0NTgwMjU0NDUyLTk3YzM1NWY2MjY3NTVjNjk3NzY1MTE5OTI4Y2Q2ZmVkMTUyNDc1MTcwYjZhYjlhOWQ2M2NjOWJkZmQyNjFlYTA)
or through [GitHub issues](https://github.com/uber-web/baseui/issues).

Once you have a better understanding of Base Web, we recommend diving into more advanced topics like:

* [How Theming works](/theming/custom-themes)
* [Understanding Overrides](/theming/understanding-overrides)
