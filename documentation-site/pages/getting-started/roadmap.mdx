# Roadmap

If you want to see what we are working on and what won't be worked on, you've come to the right place.

## Next up

Items are not necessarily in priority order.

<Table columns={['Feature']} data={[
  ['Time picker'],
  ['Layer support'],
  ['Better mobile support for all components'],
  ['Updated visuals for the sidebar component'],
  ['Dark theme'],
  ['Updated visuals for the button component'],
  ['Updated visuals for the input component'],
]} />

## Not planned

<Table columns={['Feature']} data={[
  ['Support for react-form, formik, or similar out of the box'],
]} />
