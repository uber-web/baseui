# Installing Base UI

Base UI is available on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui).

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-react styletron-react-core styletron-standard styletron-engine-atomic

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-react styletron-react-core styletron-standard styletron-engine-atomic
```

[Styletron](https://styletron.js.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the CSS in JS family. Base UI uses
Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you need to add them as dependencies too.
