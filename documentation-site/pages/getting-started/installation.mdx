# Installing Base UI

Base UI is available on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui). This single package contains all Base UI components.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react
```

[Styletron](https://www.styletron.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the CSS in JS family. Base UI uses Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you need to add them as dependencies too.

**The next step is to setup Styletron in your application.** There are [detailed guides](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/) for Fusion.js, Next.js, Gatsby and general React applications.

## With Fusion.js

If you are building a web application on top of [Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/), you have to install `fusion-plugin-styletron-react` and `styletron-react`, and register the `fusion-plugin-styletron-react` plugin. It might be installed already if you bootstrapped your Fusion application.

### Adding dependencies

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react
```

### Registering the plugin

```javascript
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Styletron from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';
import root from './components/root';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);
  app.register(Styletron);
  return app;
};
```

For more information, check out the documentation site for [fusion-plugin-styletron-react](https://fusionjs.com/api/fusion-plugin-styletron-react).

## Styletron

Base UI always needs Styletron to function. You probably will not be able to build the whole application only with Base UI components and you will be creating some new components as well. Since Styletron is already loaded in your project, **we recommend you using Styletron to style any new components**:

```js
import {styled} from 'baseui';

export default () => {
  const Anchor = styled('a', {
    fontSize: '20px',
    color: 'red',
  });
  return <Anchor href="/my-link">Custom Link</Anchor>;
};
```

What's the difference here?

```js
import {styled} from 'baseui';
import {styled} from 'styletron-react';
```

It's exactly the same `styled` function but Base UI adds the `$theme` variable that gives you access to all Base UI's [design constants](/theming/theming-values). So if you want to use our `primary` color for that custom link, you can do:

```js
import {styled} from 'baseui';

const Anchor = styled('a', ({$theme}) => ({
  color: $theme.colors.primary,
}));
```

Do you want to learn more about Styletron? Go to [styletron.org](https://www.styletron.org).

Do you prefer other approaches when styling your components? CSS Modules? Styled-components? You can use them in parallel to Base UI and Styletron. Styletron adds only `8kB` to your bundle and works in an isolation.
