# Installing Base UI

Base UI is available on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui).

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-react styletron-react-core styletron-standard styletron-engine-atomic

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-react styletron-react-core styletron-standard styletron-engine-atomic
```

[Styletron](https://styletron.js.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the CSS in JS family. Base UI uses
Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you need to add them as dependencies too.

## With Fusion.js

If you are building a web application on top of [Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/), all you have to install is the
`fusion-plugin-styletron-react` plugin, and register the plugin.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react
```

```javascript
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Styletron from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';

import root from './components/root';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);

  app.register(Styletron);

  return app;
}
```

[fusion-plugin-styletron-react](https://fusionjs.com/api/fusion-plugin-styletron-react).
