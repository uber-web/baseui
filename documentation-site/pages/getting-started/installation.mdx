# Installing Base UI

Base UI is available on [npm](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui). This single package contains all Base UI components.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react
```

[Styletron](https://www.styletron.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the CSS in JS family. Base UI uses Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you need to add them as dependencies too.

**The next step is to setup Styletron in your application.** There are [detailed guides](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/) for Fusion.js, Next.js, Gatsby and general React applications.

## With Fusion.js

If you are building a web application on top of [Fusion.js](https://fusionjs.com/), you have to install `fusion-plugin-styletron-react` and `styletron-react`, and register the `fusion-plugin-styletron-react` plugin. It might be installed already if you bootstrapped your Fusion application.

### Adding dependencies

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui fusion-plugin-styletron-react styletron-react
```

### Registering the plugin

```javascript
// src/main.js
import App from 'fusion-react';
import Styletron from 'fusion-plugin-styletron-react';
import root from './components/root';

export default () => {
  const app = new App(root);
  app.register(Styletron);
  return app;
};
```

For more information, check out the documentation site for [fusion-plugin-styletron-react](https://fusionjs.com/api/fusion-plugin-styletron-react).
