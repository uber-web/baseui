# Setup

## Installing Base Web

Base Web is available on npm as [baseui](https://npmjs.com/package/baseui). This single
package contains all Base Web components.

```bash
# using yarn
yarn add baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react

# using npm
npm install baseui styletron-engine-atomic styletron-react
```

Base Web comes with both Flow and TypeScript. Styletron comes only with Flow. However, if you use
TypeScript there are external TypeScript declarations:

```bash
yarn add @types/styletron-standard @types/styletron-react @types/styletron-engine-atomic
```

Our React components don't use [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html).

[Styletron](https://www.styletron.org/) is a toolkit for component-oriented styling, part of the
CSS in JS family. Base Web uses Styletron as a peer dependency to style all the elements, so you
need to add them as dependencies too.

## Adding Base Web to Your Application

In order to use Base Web, you need to do a small setup and wrap the root of your
application with `StyletronProvider` and [`BaseProvider`](https://baseweb.design/components/base-provider) components:

```javascript
import {Client as Styletron} from 'styletron-engine-atomic';
import {Provider as StyletronProvider} from 'styletron-react';
import {LightTheme, BaseProvider, styled} from 'baseui';
import {StatefulInput} from 'baseui/input';

const engine = new Styletron();

const Centered = styled('div', {
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  height: '100%',
});

export default function Hello() {
  return (
    <StyletronProvider value={engine}>
      <BaseProvider theme={LightTheme}>
        <Centered>
          <StatefulInput />
        </Centered>
      </BaseProvider>
    </StyletronProvider>
  );
}
```

There are detailed guides for Styletron setup for the following frameworks:

- [Fusion.js](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-fusionjs)
- [Next.js](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-nextjs)
- [Gatsby](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-gatsby)
- [Other React applications](https://www.styletron.org/getting-started/#with-react)
- [Bedrock](http://t.uber.com/base-bedrock) (Uber only)
