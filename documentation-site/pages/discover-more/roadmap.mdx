# Roadmap

If you want to see what we are working on and what won't be worked on, you've come to the right place.

## Next up

Items are not necessarily in priority order.

<Table
  columns={['Feature']}
  data={[
    ['Revised color palette (example: black buttons)'],
    ['Revised typography and semantics, refined outlines'],
    ['Better mobile support for all components'],
    ['Updated visuals for the sidebar component'],
    ['Interactive API documentation'],
  ]}
/>

## Not planned

The following items won't be included in any future Base Web releases.

<Table
  columns={['Feature']}
  data={[['Support for react-form, formik, or similar out of the box']]}
/>
