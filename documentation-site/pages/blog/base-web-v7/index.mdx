## React version requirements

To enable the use of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), Base Web 7 requires React 16.8 or higher.

## `Select` component changes

The Pagination component was refactored to reuse the `Select` component for its dropdown element.
The change only effects you if you used overrides.

### Pagination

- `StyledDropdownMenu` export was removed
- `StyledDropdownButton` export was removed
- `overrides` prop changes:
  - `DropdownButton` override was removed
  - `DropdownMenu` override was removed
  - `Select` override was added. Please note that `Select` identifier in the pagination overrides
  object is for a component and not a styled element. Refer to the API of
  the [`Select` component](https://baseweb.design/components/select/) for the full list of its props.

## `Side Navigation` component changes

The purpose of this change is to rename the Side Navigation item prop
`subnav` to `subNav` for consistency with the camel-cased styled component.
To upgrade, update `subnav` item prop to `subNav`.

## `Button` component changes

Base Web 7 ships with an updated visual for the `Button` component. As part of the update `Button`
components got uniform padding on all sides. This change made the `square` shape
redundant so it has been removed.

## `Tag` component changes

We've removed the deprecated `COLOR_STYLE_KEYS` export from the Tag component.
Instead of that, please use `KIND` and `VARIANT` exports.

## `Radio` component changes

Base Web 7 removed `StyledRadio` and `StyledRadioMark` overrides and subcomponents.

If you've used `StyledRadio`,  please update your code to use the `Radio` component instead. See examples [here](https://baseui.design/components/radio/).

If you've used `StyledRadioMark`, please update your code to use the `StyledRadioInner` and `StyledRadioOuter` instead.
If you are using the `StyledRadio` component, replace that with the `Radio` component and this warning
should go away. See examples [here](https://baseui.design/components/radio/).

## `RadioGroup` component changes

To be consistent accross components, we've removed the use of `ariaLabel` and `ariaLabelledBy`. Please use `aria-label` and `aria-labelled-by` instead.

## `Tab` component changes

Base Web 7 removed the unnecessary `TabPanel` subcomponent. Use `Tab` instead of the `TabPanel` subcomponent.

## Theme changes

We removed the deprecated properties from the theme object. It only affects you if you've used your own theme
with the `Tag` or `Tooltip` components.

To update your theme, please take a look at the update shape of the
theme object [here](https://baseweb.design/theming/custom-themes/#the-shape-of-the-theme-file).

## Updated Button component visuals

As part of the Base Web 7 release, we've updated the `Button` component visuals, and introduced a `Large` size.
