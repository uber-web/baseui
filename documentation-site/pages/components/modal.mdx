# Modal

A design structure to organize and hide content, so as not to overwhelm the user.

Modals provide an opportunity to display content, focused actions or alerts while maintaining the
context of an existing view. This limits workflow interruptions and allows for focused
communication and user interactions. There are two types of modals in Base – default and alert.
Each modal share the same anatomy of a header, footer, and shaded background overlay.

Standard modals are basic containers with a close “X” and the ability the dismiss by clicking outside
of the modal bounds. The primary action button is a primary system color, complimented by a grey
cancel action.

The alert modal is to intended to focus the user on an urgent message that requires deliberate
action. By contrast to standard modals, alert modals have no close “X”, nor do they allow for out
of bounds dismissal. The primary action is always a system red with a grey cancel action.

## Accessibility

- Upon opening, focus will be transferred to the dialog itself (unless `autofocus` is set to false)
- Dialog element has `aria-modal="true"`
- Explicitly exposes a `role` prop to control whether `dialog` or `alertdialog` is used.
- `Tab` key moves between focusable items (form inputs, footer buttons, etc). User should not be able to tab to items outside of modal – lucky for us most modern browsers seem to enforce this by default now for role dialog or aria-modal.
- `Escape` key closes the modal
- Click on backdrop (anywhere outside dialog) hides modal.
- Background is not be scrollable while modal is open (position: fixed).
