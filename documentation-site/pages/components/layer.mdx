# Layers

Every UI has stackable layers and it's important to have control over how the layers
play together. Some examples of the stackable layers are tooltips, modals, popovers,
select dropdowns or menus. The issues that come up along the layers usage are z-index
and visibility handling, what layer goes on top. There are many other layer
related issues that include focus management, hover management, keyboard navigation,
click events and hotkeys usage.

`Layer` component renders its children into a host element, instead of the `body`
element, using `createPortal`. The application needs to be wrapped in a `LayersManager`
in order to handle the rendering into a container. If no `LayersManager` is added
the content will be added to the `body`. With layers there is no need for `z-index`
css property usage as layers completely rely on the stacking context.

# Tether behavior

`Tether` component provides a behavior where its content positioned relatively to a provided anchor element. Popover component is a good example of the `Tether` component usage.

  <TetherBasic />
