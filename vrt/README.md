# Visual testing

We use `jest-image-snapshot` for a simple suite of visual regression tests (VRT). Note, that the current system is a work in progress and may change in the future.

## Set up

The suite will pick up and run any test file with the `*.vrt.js` extension. By default we turn every storybook scenario file into a single snapshot test. To add a new test, simply create a new `.scenario.js` file in the `__tests__` directory of a component.

> Note, a temporary requirement is that the export `name` and file name of the scenario are identical.

You can also add an interaction test for an existing scenario. Simply update the object exported by `vrt/interactions.js`.

```js
// vrt/interactions.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  'input-password': [
    {
      name: 'togglesMask',
      behavior: async page => {
        const toggleSelector = `[data-e2e="mask-toggle"]`;
        await page.$(toggleSelector);
        await page.click(toggleSelector);
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The key on the object is the name of the scenario to run interactions against. In the above example, we are adding an interaction for the  `input-password` scenario.

Each scenario/key should reference an array of interaction descriptor objects. These objects require two properties:

1. A `name`, which will be appended to the snapshot file name for identification.
2. A `behavior`, which is an async function that is passed `page`, a Puppeteer Page instance. Use `page` to arrange the scenario however you like. The actual snapshot will be generated after this `behavior` function resolves.

In the example above we click the password input's toggle maskÂ button to verify that the text properly unmasks. This snapshot is saved separately in our snapshot directory as `input-password__togglesMask.png`.

## Docker

The visual regression tests are run within a Docker container so you will have inconsistent results with our saved snapshots if you do not run the tests in Docker.

To run the tests locally you can use `docker-compose`:

To prepare the visual tests:
```
$ docker-compose down    # ensure prior services are not running
$ docker-compose build   # required after any change to source
```

The first run of `docker-compose build` may take a little while. Subsequent runs should go faster.

To run the visual tests:
```
$ docker-compose run e2e-test bash -c "yarn add puppeteer && yarn vrt"
```

To update the visual test snapshots:
```
$ docker-compose run e2e-test bash -c "yarn add puppeteer && yarn vrt -u"
```

Note, you can still run the test suite locally for debugging purposes with `yarn vrt`, but the official snapshots must be generated and updated with Docker. CI will not pass otherwise.

## CI

If there are any visual regression diffs detected in the `vrt` job, they will be uploaded as artifacts to the build step in Buildkite. Simply follow the link to the failed job, then click the `Artifacts` tab on that job. There should be a list of images that display the offending diffs.

You can then either fix the regressions or update the snapshots locally (see Docker section above).
