# Purpose

Button designs were updated to have uniform padding on all sides.
This change made the `square` shape redundant so it has been removed.

## Button

The main use case for the `square` shape was to create square buttons with an icon inside of them.
This use case is supported by default now.
You can simply remove the `shape="square"` property.

```diff
- <Button shape="square">
+ <Button>
    <Upload />
  </Button>
```
