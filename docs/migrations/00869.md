# Purpose

The purpose of this change was to fix and simplify Slider's API. It removes the `range` prop so non-uniform step distribution is no longer supported. However, it introduces `min` and `max` props so you can still set the upper and lower boundaries.

## Slider

Basic use-case of `range` prop can be replaced by `min` and `max`

```diff
- <Slider range={[0, 100]} />
+ <Slider min={0} max={100} />
```
