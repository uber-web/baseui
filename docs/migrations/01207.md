# Changes in Base Web@v7

## Required React version

To enable the use of [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), please update your React version to 16.8 or higher.

## Theme changes

We are removing deprecated properties from the theme object. It only affects you if you've used your own theme
with the `Tag`, `Tooltip` or `Input` components.

To update your theme, please take a look at the update shape of the theme object [here](https://baseweb.design/theming/custom-themes/#the-shape-of-the-theme-file).

## Pagination

The Pagination component was refactored to reuse the `Select` component for its dropdown element. The change only effects you if you used overrides.

### Migrating the `Pagination` component

- `StyledDropdownMenu` export was removed
- `StyledDropdownButton` export was removed
- `overrides` prop changes:
  - `DropdownButton` override was removed
  - `DropdownMenu` override was removed
  - `Select` override was added. Please note that `Select` identifier in the pagination overrides object is for a component and not a styled element. Refer to the API of the [`Select` component](https://baseweb.design/components/select/) for the full list of its props.

```diff
- import {StyledDropdownMenu} from 'baseui/select';
- import {StyledDropdownButton} from 'baseui/select';

  <StatefulPagination
    numPages={10}
    overrides={{
-     DropdownButton: {props: {kind: KIND.secondary}},
-     DropdownMenu: {style: {width: '300px'}},
    }}
  />
```

## Side Navigation

The purpose of this change is to rename the Side Navigation item prop `subnav` to `subNav` for consistency with the camel-cased styled component.

Also, as the `renderItem` prop is not necessary since it's identical to `overrides.NavLink.component`, we've removed it.

### Migrating the `Side Navigation` component

Update `subnav` item prop to `subNav`:

```diff
const nav = [
  {
    title: 'Colors',
    itemId: '#level1.1',
-   subnav: [
+   subNav: [
      {
        title: 'Primary',
        itemId: '#level1.1.1',
      },
      {
        title: 'Shades',
        itemId: '#level1.1.2',
-       subnav: [
+       subNav: [
          {
            title: 'Dark',
            itemId: '#level1.1.2.1',
          },
          {
            title: 'Light',
            itemId: '#level1.1.2.2',
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    title: 'Sizing',
    itemId: '#level1.2',
  },
  {
    title: 'Typography',
    itemId: '#level1.3',
  },
];

export default () => {
  const [location, setLocation] = useState('#level1.1.1');
  return (
    <Navigation
      items={nav}
      activeItemId={location}
      onChange={({item}) => setLocation(item.itemId)}
    />
  );
};
```

Update from `renderItem` to overrides:

```diff
- <Navigation renderItem={MyItem} />
+ <Navigation overrides={{ NavLink: { component: MyItem }}} />
```

## Button

Button designs were updated to have uniform padding on all sides.
This change made the `square` shape redundant so it has been removed.

### Migrating the `Button` component

The main use case for the `square` shape was to create square buttons with an icon inside of them.
This use case is supported by default now.
You can simply remove the `shape="square"` property.

```diff
- <Button shape="square">
+ <Button>
    <Upload />
  </Button>
```

## Tag

We've removed the deprecated `COLOR_STYLE_KEYS` export from the Tag component. Instead of that, please use the `KIND` and `VARIANT` exports.

## RadioGroup

To be consistent accross components, we'll use `aria-label` and `aria-labelled-by` in every components.

### Migrating the `RadioGroup` component

```diff
- `ariaLabel="myLabel"`
+ `aria-label="myLabel"`
```

## Radio

Removes `StyledRadio` and `StyledRadioMark` overrides and components.

### Migrating the `Radio` component

`StyledRadio`: Update your code to use the `Radio` component instead. See examples at https://baseui.design/components/radio/.

`StyledRadioMark`: Update your code to use the `StyledRadioInner` and `StyledRadioOuter` instead. If you
are using the `StyledRadio` component, replace that with the `Radio` component and this warning
should go away. See examples at https://baseui.design/components/radio/.

```diff
<Radio
  overrides={{
-   Radio: {},
+   RadioInner: {},
+   RadioOuter: {},
  }}
  value="1"
>
  option
</Radio>
```

## Tab

Removes the unnecessary `TabPanel` component.

### Migrating the `Tab` component

```diff
<StatefulTabs initialState={{activeKey: '0'}}>
- <TabPanel title="Tab Link 1">Tab 1 content</TabPanel>
+ <Tab title="Tab Link 1">Tab 1 content</Tab>
</StatefulTabs>
```
